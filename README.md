Momentum trading is a popular and dynamic investment strategy that aims to capitalize on the continuation of existing market trends. This strategy focuses on identifying and riding the momentum of stocks, commodities, or other financial instruments that exhibit strong upward or downward price movements. Momentum traders believe that these trends will persist in the short term, allowing them to generate profits by buying or selling assets accordingly.

The basic momentum trading algorithm is set up with the name basic_algo.py and uses simple techniques to implement a way of analysing stock prices. This will be further developed to make it more practical and accurate when used in the real world, and not on yahoo finance API.
